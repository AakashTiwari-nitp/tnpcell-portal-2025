## "document" is not defined (Error)

- This error may come to you for after running the frontend this is basically due to SSR.
- To handle this you should apply the dynamic imports in files containing "Lottie" (About.js , Loading.js and WhyUs.js) under *frontend/components/LandingPageElements*

```
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const Lottie = dynamic(()=>import("lottie-react"),{ssr:false})
```

- **Never commit these changes this is only to remove the development error, it is not an error at the production**

## Do's and Don'ts
- Always remove the console.logs which you have created while developing any feature or fixing bugs.
- Make sure you don't expose or hardcode the Backend URL in any of your function.
- Never commit the setup works which you have done inorder to run the project locally.
- Make a new branch for every new bug fixing or feature.
- Your local master || main branch should always be updated with the remote's main branch
- Never make a pull request in the master branch, use test branch for it.
- Pull request must have a detailed description about its intent, you can check the pull request template in **pull_request_template.md**.
- The commits' messages and pull requests titles must be clear about the purpose they serve.
- Watch the official repository so you will be informed about every actions there.
